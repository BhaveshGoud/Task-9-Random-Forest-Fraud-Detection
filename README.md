# Task 9: Random Forest – Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Dataset
Credit Card Fraud Dataset (Kaggle)

## Objective
To detect fraudulent transactions using Random Forest while handling class imbalance.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Steps Performed
- Data loading and imbalance analysis
- Stratified train-test split
- Baseline Logistic Regression model
- Random Forest training with class balancing
- Evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score
- Feature importance visualization
- Model saving using joblib

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook
- Feature importance plot
- Saved Random Forest model

## Outcome
Learned ensemble learning techniques and effective handling of imbalanced datasets.
## Dataset
The Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset is publicly available on Kaggle.  
Due to its large size, the dataset is not included in this repository.
